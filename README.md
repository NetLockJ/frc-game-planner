# Game Planner

This is the repository for Game Planner, designed for use by FRC teams for game related strategy. 

It functions in the browser, and can either be run by downloading the code from the current year branch, and running locally, or by visiting [the online version](https://netlockj.github.io/frc-game-planner/).

The background is from PathPlanner, please check out the awesome tool [here](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner)!

Good Luck to all FRC teams!
